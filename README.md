# Hi there, I’m Rutwik Patel 👋

> Software Engineer who loves building **cool, reliable, and scalable things**. With 5+ years of backend experience—across payments, infra, AI-chatbots, and online judges—I focus on shipping products that users love and systems that engineers can trust. Always curious, always learning (currently exploring **mobile development** 📱).

Fun fact: I’m **not from IIT but NIT… wait wait, Nirma Institute of Technology, Ahmedabad** 🎓.

## ⚡ Projects

### 💳 Payment & Settlement System

Designed and deployed secure automated settlement modules (T+3 cycle) and APIs for UPI, FASTag, and wallet-based EV payments. Processed **50+ bills/minute** and scaled reliably to thousands of users.

### 🤖 AI-powered Chatbot

Built and owned backends for chatbots using **LangChain + GPT**. Supported real-time diagnostics, routing, debugging, and charge transactions and charge point owners. Deployed with AWS infra and CI/CD pipelines.

### 🏆 Online Judge Platform

Architected and scaled a platform serving \~**3,000 students** with 100+ concurrent submissions. Implemented a custom autoscaling algorithm reducing infra costs by **70%** while improving contest performance.

### 📝 Adaptive Test System

Created a real-time admission test system with WebSocket-based code sync, automated proctoring, and CI/CD. Supported large-scale student assessments with seamless infra.

### ⚡ Infra Automation

Set up autoscaling infra with EC2 Spot instances, CloudWatch alarms, and custom scaling rules—delivering **high reliability at low cost**.
